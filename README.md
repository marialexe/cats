# cats

JavaScript in browser day1 - Homework

Use the provided start_point and complete the following tasks:

Add JS code to allow a new cat to be added programmatically. Do it rough and ready at first!
Refactor the code to make it easy to add a new cat, just like we did with the quotes.
EXTENSION: Remove the cat data in the HTML and add them via your javascript. 
If you want to be fancy, put the cat data into an array.
EXTENSION: Style the site!
Hint: Be careful with the order you append your elements to each other!
Also be careful with what you need to pass when setting an image's width via the DOM.


N.B. This homework was done using the JS server framework Express. 
     To bring down the framework, please use the commands: npm install and npm start.
